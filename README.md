Hi there, I'm Rhys Hill 👋
A dedicated and highly reliable professional currently transitioning into the world of cybersecurity. I am excited to begin my BSc (Hons) in Cybersecurity at the University of Gloucestershire in September 2025.

With two years of experience in the fast-paced hospitality industry, where I maintained a record of perfect attendance, I am now channeling my strong work ethic, time management skills, and passion for problem-solving into building a successful career in security.

🚀 Why Cybersecurity?
"I was drawn to cybersecurity over other tech fields because of its dynamic and ever-evolving nature. The promise of tackling constant, unique challenges is incredibly exciting, and I am motivated to build a long-term, impactful career in a field essential to our digital world."

🛠️ Skills & Core Competencies
